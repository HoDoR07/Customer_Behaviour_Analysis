# 📊 Customer Behavior Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior to uncover insights related to purchasing patterns, customer segments, discounts, subscriptions, and revenue contribution. The project uses **Python for data cleaning and transformation**, **PostgreSQL & SQL for analysis**, and is designed to support **business decision-making through structured data insights**.


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python** (Pandas, SQLAlchemy)
* **PostgreSQL**
* **SQL**
* **Power BI** (for visualization)
* **CSV Dataset**


## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset (`customer_shopping_behavior.csv`) contains customer-level information such as:

* Age, Gender
* Category & Item Purchased
* Purchase Amount
* Review Ratings
* Discount & Subscription Status
* Shipping Type
* Purchase Frequency
* Previous Purchases



## ⚙️ Data Processing (Python)

The following data preprocessing steps were performed using **Python (Pandas)**:

* Loaded CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame
* Handled missing values in **Review Rating** using median values grouped by category
* Standardized column names (lowercase and underscores)
* Renamed columns for consistency
* Created new features:

  * **Age Group** (Young Adult, Adult, Middle Age, Senior)
  * **Purchase Frequency (Days)** mapped from textual values
* Removed redundant columns
* Loaded the cleaned data into **PostgreSQL** using SQLAlchemy



## 🗄️ Database Integration

* Created a PostgreSQL database named `customer_behavior`
* Loaded the cleaned dataset into a table named `customer`
* Enabled SQL-based analytical queries for deeper insights



## 📈 SQL Analysis Performed

The following business questions were answered using SQL:

1. Total revenue generated by **Male vs Female** customers
2. Customers who used discounts and spent **above average**
3. **Top 5 products** with the highest average review ratings
4. Comparison of **Standard vs Express Shipping** purchase amounts
5. Spending behavior of **Subscribed vs Non-Subscribed** customers
6. Products with the **highest discount usage percentage**
7. Customer segmentation into **New, Returning, Loyal** customers
8. **Top 3 most purchased products** in each category
9. Subscription likelihood among **repeat buyers**
10. Revenue contribution by **Age Group**



## 📊 Visualization

The analyzed data was visualized using **Power BI**, including:

* Customer segmentation dashboards
* Revenue trends by age group and gender
* Product performance analysis
* Subscription and discount impact analysis



## 🎯 Key Insights

* Subscribed customers tend to generate higher total revenue
* Certain products rely heavily on discounts to drive sales
* Middle-aged and adult customers contribute the highest revenue
* Repeat buyers show a stronger tendency to subscribe



## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required Python libraries

   ```bash
   pip install pandas sqlalchemy psycopg2
   ```
3. Ensure PostgreSQL is running locally
4. Update database credentials in the Python script
5. Run the Python file to load data into PostgreSQL
6. Execute SQL queries for analysis
7. Connect Power BI to PostgreSQL for visualization



## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, covering data cleaning, feature engineering, database integration, SQL analysis, and dashboard creation. It highlights practical skills required for a **Data Analyst role**, including Python, SQL, and business-focused analysis.
